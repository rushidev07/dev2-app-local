# MarkShust_PolyshellPatch

Mitigates the PolyShell vulnerability — an unrestricted file upload in the Magento REST API that allows attackers to upload executable files via cart item custom option file uploads.

## What this module does

Two plugins enforce an image-only extension allowlist (`jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `png`):

1. **ImageContentValidatorExtension** — rejects filenames with non-image extensions before the file is written to disk.
2. **ImageProcessorRestrictExtensions** — calls `setAllowedExtensions()` on the `Uploader` so the framework's own extension check blocks dangerous files as a second layer.

## Installation

```bash
composer require markshust/magento2-module-polyshell-patch
bin/magento module:enable MarkShust_PolyshellPatch
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento cache:flush
```

## Web server hardening (required for production)

The module blocks uploads at the application layer, but defense-in-depth requires blocking execution/access at the web server level too. Apply the appropriate config below.

### Nginx

Add this **before** any `location ~ \.php$` block to prevent it from taking priority:

```nginx
location ^~ /media/custom_options/ {
    deny all;
    return 403;
}
```

Verify the order matters — nginx processes `^~` prefix matches before regex matches, so this ensures `.php` files in this directory are never passed to FastCGI.

Reload after applying:

```bash
nginx -t && nginx -s reload
```

### Apache

Verify that `pub/media/custom_options/.htaccess` exists and contains:

```apache
<IfVersion < 2.4>
    order deny,allow
    deny from all
</IfVersion>
<IfVersion >= 2.4>
    Require all denied
</IfVersion>
```

Also confirm that `AllowOverride All` is set for your document root so `.htaccess` files are honored.

## Scan for existing compromise

Check whether any files have already been uploaded to the custom_options directory:

```bash
find pub/media/custom_options/ -type f ! -name '.htaccess'
```

If any files are found (especially `.php`, `.phtml`, or `.phar`), investigate immediately — they may be webshells.

## When to remove this module

This module is an interim hotfix. Remove it once Adobe backports the official patch to production Magento versions (2.4.8-p4 or later). To remove:

If you have installed it manually:

```bash
bin/magento module:disable MarkShust_PolyshellPatch
bin/magento setup:upgrade
rm -rf app/code/MarkShust/PolyshellPatch
bin/magento cache:flush
```

If you have installed it by composer:

```bash
bin/magento module:disable MarkShust_PolyshellPatch
bin/magento setup:upgrade
composer remove markshust/magento2-module-polyshell-patch
bin/magento cache:flush
```

## Why this module is intentionally minimal

Adobe's [official fix](https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/796c4ce195cee0814ac92e5a19fc2ecfa79dae69) spans 18 files (+997 lines) across `Magento_Catalog`, `Magento_Quote`, and the framework. It introduces a new `ImageContentProcessor`, a `CartItemValidatorChain` at the Repository layer, an `ImageContentUploaderInterface`, and API-scoped DI configuration.

We intentionally did not replicate that approach because:

- **It modifies core module internals.** The official patch alters constructors, adds dependencies to `CustomOptionProcessor` and `Repository`, and introduces new interfaces — changes that are tightly coupled to specific Magento versions and could conflict with the official patch when it ships.
- **A minimal allowlist is sufficient to block the exploit.** The vulnerability is that any file extension is accepted. Our two plugins enforce a strict image-only allowlist (`jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `png`) at both the validator and uploader level. This is actually stricter than the official fix, which uses a denylist approach (`NotProtectedExtension`) that rejects known-dangerous extensions.
- **Lower risk of side effects.** A small, self-contained module with two plugins is easy to audit, test, and remove cleanly — which is exactly what you want from a temporary hotfix.
